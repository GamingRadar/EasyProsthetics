# **EasyProsthetics** – The Custom Prosthetic Model Generator 🦾

**EasyProsthetics** is an exciting tool that lets you create **custom prosthetic models** with just a few simple measurements. Whether it's for prosthetic arms, implants, or other specialized 3D models, the possibilities are endless! 🌟

> **WIP** 🚧 This project is still a **Work in Progress**, and we're eager to see it evolve. Contributions are more than welcome! Help us shape this tool into something even more amazing. 🌱

I made this cause I felt there should be a thing that should exist, yet not, Let me know what you think—seriously, I’d love your feedback and contribution! ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/devashishtambade/))

## **Why EasyProsthetics?**

Creating a prosthetic model usually requires expensive equipment and specialized knowledge. But with **EasyProsthetics**, **you** can design a prosthetic that's tailored to your needs, **simply** by providing measurements. 

Here’s what makes this tool special:
- **Customizable Model Generation**: Input details like base circumference, wrist height, palm width, finger circumference, and finger height to design a prosthetic that’s perfectly fitted to you. 📏
- **Limitless Potential**: While it currently features a prosthetic arm model, this tool can easily be adapted for **implants**, **orthotics**, and **any custom 3D model** you can imagine. 🤖
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Upload any parametric SCAD file, modify the parameters through an intuitive form, and instantly generate a custom model that fits your exact needs. ⚙️
- **STL File Export**: Generate an STL file that’s ready for 3D printing once you’re happy with the model. 🖨️
- **Open Source & Collaborative**: This project is **open to contributions**! Whether you want to fix bugs, add new features, or refine the design, we welcome your input. 🙌

## **How It Works: Simple Steps**

1. **Upload Your SCAD File**: Upload any SCAD file that defines a parametric model to the Colab notebook. 🗂️
2. **Enter Your Measurements**: Provide measurements like base circumference, wrist height, palm width, and finger dimensions. Use millimeters for **extra precision**. 🔍
3. **Generate Your Custom Model**: Hit a button, and **EasyProsthetics** will generate a model based on your measurements. ✨
4. **Download the STL File**: Once your model is ready, download the STL file for 3D printing. ⬇️

## **Setup**
